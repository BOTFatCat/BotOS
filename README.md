# BotOS
A Terminal Operating System (kind of)

# About BotOS
This program is created mostly in python.(with some help from sheel commands)
This was a really interesting and fun experince. I spend weeks on making this with a little help from google. I really learned alot from this and I hope those who want to contribute may enjoy this aswell as I do.

# System Requirements
As far as I know, the script currently works on MacOS Terminal. It may work on Linux Terminals. I haven't tried this script on any other system than my Macbook Air.

- MacOS version 10.12 or later
- Python 3.10 or later
- jp2a (optional but I recommend)
- 1.6Ghz processor or better
- Any sound card
- Any low-end graphics card

# Setup
- First, use your favorite python editor to change the directories of the files like: /Users/user/Desktop/BotOSv1.0/thefile
- Then, go to your Terminal and change the directory to the folder
- Finally, use
>python3 BotOSv1.0.py

# Finally Enjoy :trollface:
